Event Task

I have completed the task and uploaded the code. I did it in around **5** hours.

As soon as you run the code the **migrations** script should run and the database and table would be created automatically in MySQL database. **You just need to update your connection string in the appsetting.json file.**

After this, on running the code you will get a swagger document. So you can try various API results from this.

1) Hitting the GetEventInfo Method returns the user details by fetching user data from the API mentioned.

**All the data can be verified in the database all well**

6)  You can also delete the event using the delete API

   I have also created a **unit test project** for the methods. Here are the unit test results
